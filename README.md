# Microsoft Teams: Available if Screen On

This Chrome extension will keep your status as 'Available' when the screensaver is inactive

**Note**: I fully support the use of this functionality for use at a workplace

## Installation

Install directly from source, but only after carefully reading through all of the source code and making it your own. I would not trust the chrome web store for anything interacting with workplace tools.

This is my first chrome extension. With akump's repo and this blog post I got going...
